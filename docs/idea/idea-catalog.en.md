## Particularly Cerune-like Candidates

The following ideas make especially good use of Cerune's current direction:

- **RV32I / custom CPU**
- **Tiny language + multiple executors**
- **Observable SSA / optimization passes**
- **Differential compiler testing**
- **Delta debugging**
- **Exhaustive verification of AI-generated optimization rules**
- **Source→machine provenance**
- **Backend cost of checked arithmetic**
- **f32/f64 divergence gallery**
- **Bounded model checking**
- **Distributed-protocol simulation**
- **Self-hosting countdown**

In many languages, these projects are simply things that can be built. In Cerune, the transformation itself can become part of the experiment:

`source → HIR → MIR → VM / C / LLVM / QBE / WAT / Native`

The interesting question is not only whether the program runs, but how its representation changes across those routes and whether its meaning remains the same.
