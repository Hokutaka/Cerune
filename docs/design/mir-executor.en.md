# Independent MIR execution

[日本語](mir-executor.ja.md) · [IR stages](ir-stages.en.md)

## Role and current coverage

`run-mir` lowers completed Cerune IR into non-SSA MIR, then directly executes its locals, instructions, and blocks. It supports current types, functions, modules, generics, match, fixed/dynamic arrays, strings, ownership operations, and runtime diagnostics. The common frontend still resolves names, types, and ownership.

| Command | Executed representation | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `run` / `run-ir` | Completed Cerune IR (HIR) | Default direct execution |
| `run-mir` | Non-SSA MIR | Independent route for comparing HIR→MIR semantics |
| `run-vm` | Bytecode | VM instruction execution |
| `emit-mir` | None | Observe MIR operations, edges, and origins |

MIR execution does not reconstruct HIR or bytecode for execution. It does not introduce another build/release artifact. [Native consumes the same MIR](native-mir.en.md). [SSA construction and direct execution](mir-ssa.en.md) are available through separate Rust APIs. Optimization and external MIR loading remain unimplemented.

## Implementation and sharing

Control flow is separate from atomic value operations.

| Implementation | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| [mir_executor.rs](../../src/mir_executor.rs) | Local frames, instructions, branch/jump/return, calls, and MIR failure locations |
| [mir_executor/semantics.rs](../../src/mir_executor/semantics.rs) | Individual instructions, operations, and ownership shared by MIR/SSA; each executor owns its CFG and value references |
| [runtime/value.rs](../../src/runtime/value.rs) | Value representation, arithmetic/comparisons/bit operations, and display shared by HIR/MIR/SSA; no control flow |
| [runtime/numeric.rs](../../src/runtime/numeric.rs) | Numeric conversion and rounding rules |
| [runtime/string_heap.rs](../../src/runtime/string_heap.rs), [array_heap.rs](../../src/runtime/array_heap.rs) | Logical ownership counts, allocation budgets, reclamation |
| [mir/validate.rs](../../src/mir/validate.rs) | Structure, types, initialization, and preceding index checks before execution |

Rust clones for reads and temporaries do not retain logical ownership or perform independent dynamic copies. Only explicit MIR allocation/copy loops/retain/release/free change language ownership. No ABI or host-OS inference switches execution behavior.

Lowering inserts a `synthetic=entry-main-call` instruction for the `main` call after the entry body. The MIR executor does not infer calls from function names. A callee failure retains the callee instruction and original source location.

## API and failures

Use `run_mir(source)` for source text, or `modules::load(path)?.to_ir()`→`mir::lower(&hir)`→`mir_executor::run(&mir)` for imports. Every run has independent state and leaves HIR/MIR unchanged.

`MirRunError` separates construction from execution errors. Execution errors expose the following data.

| API | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `kind()` | Validation failure, language failure code, or execution-time internal inconsistency |
| `origin()` | Original HIR NodeId and Span including SourceId |
| `location()` | MIR FunctionId (None for entry), BlockId, InstructionId; not overwritten by callers |
| `output()` | Output produced before failure |
| `runtime_failure()` | Shared failure record for language failures only |

Validation errors precede execution and have empty output. CLI `--diagnostic-format runtime-v1` preserves the same code, original location, and prior output as other routes. Default diagnostics locate the source file; the Rust API exposes MIR instruction IDs for comparison with `emit-mir`.

## Ownership checks and limits

Successful execution must leave no live string/array heap storage. Leftover allocations produce an internal error instead of success. Failed execution reclaims its state, including partially initialized storage, when that state is dropped.

This is not a static proof of every lifetime path. Static alias/partial-initialization/retain/release path verification remains unimplemented. The API accepts compiler-constructed MIR and is not a sandbox or execution-time limiter for hostile input. Recursion remains unsupported by the language; a recursive call created by mutating MIR is also rejected as an internal error.

## Comparisons and examples

[control_flow.ceru](../../examples/ir_stages/control_flow.ceru) illustrates short-circuit and loop edges. [owned_values.ceru](../../examples/ir_stages/owned_values.ceru) exercises functions, dynamic arrays, strings, and cleanup through continue.

```sh
cargo run --quiet -- run-mir examples/ir_stages/owned_values.ceru
cargo run --quiet -- emit-mir examples/ir_stages/owned_values.ceru -o target/owned_values.mir.txt
cargo run --quiet -- run-mir examples/dynamic_arrays/lowering_order.ceru --array-heap-limit 47 --diagnostic-format runtime-v1
```

The last command intentionally exceeds the budget: only `begin` is printed, followed by `allocation-limit-exceeded` at the original argument-copy site. A passing failure test checks that stop against its expected result.

The [IR comparison tests](../../tests/ir_executor.rs) and [dynamic-array comparisons](../../tests/dynamic_arrays.rs) include MIR and check known output, codes, origins, and prior output. [MIR-specific tests](../../tests/mir_executor.rs) check that changing MIR itself changes execution, retain callee locations, and detect missing cleanup. Windows/Linux dynamic-array comparisons cover nine routes: HIR, MIR, VM, C, LLVM, QBE, WAT, ASM, and self-encoded objects.

HIR/MIR comparisons alone cannot detect bugs in their shared value operations, so tests also use VM/generated routes and known expectations. Execution agreement is testing, not formal proof or a performance-equivalence guarantee.
